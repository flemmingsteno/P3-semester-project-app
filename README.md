# P3 exams app for 3. semester cs-21-dv-3-02

The purpose of the application is to show relevant points from the analysis through storytelling and to answer the problem statement without the user having to search too much for the answers. When using storytelling through data visualization, the interactivity will be limited because it is not the user's assignment to find the specific combination of variables or a specific range on a variable.

When running the app, wait for a little while the program loads the data and greates the figures. Click the "Generate graphs"-button to generate the graphs.
The program is a little buggy. When opening the web site you will see four errors, however they do not effect the program.
